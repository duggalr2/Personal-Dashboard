“There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating college student.”
“Being strongwilled is not enough however. You also have to be hard on yourself. Someone who was strongwilled but selfindulgent would not be called determined. Determination implies your willfulness is balanced by discipline.”
“At every period of history people have believed things that were just ridiculous and believed them so strongly that you risked ostracism or even violence by saying otherwise. If our own time were any different that would be remarkable. As far as I can tell it isn't.”
“If you leave a bunch of elevenyearolds to their own devices what you get is Lord of the Flies. Like a lot of American kids I read this book in school. Presumably it was not a coincidence. Presumably someone wanted to point out to us that we were savages and that we had made ourselves a cruel and stupid world. This was too subtle for me. While the book seemed entirely believable I didn't get the additional message. I wish they had just told us outright that we were savages and our world was stupid.”
“If you want to make money at some point remember this because this is one of the reasons startups win. Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when you damp oscillations you lose the high points as well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies because they don't win by making great products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies. ”
“Objectoriented programming offers a sustainable way to write spaghetti code. It lets you accrete programs as a series of patches.”
“Let's start with a test: Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers?If the answer is no you might want to stop and think about that. If everything you believe is something you're supposed to believe could that possibly be a coincidence? Odds are it isn't. Odds are you just think whatever you're told.”
“The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste plus the ability to gratify it.”
“It's important for nerds to realize too that school is not life. School is a strange artificial thing half sterile and half feral. It's allencompassing like life but it isn't the real thing. It's only temporary and if you look you can see beyond it even while you're still in it.”
“You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people to make something customers actually want and to spend as little money as possible.”
“The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about.”
“if you can imagine someone surpassing you you should do it yourself.”
“A startup is like a mosquito. A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one but a mosquito is designed for one thing : to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos as a species is that there are a lot of them but this is little consolation to the individual mosquito.”
“I'm not saying there's no such thing as genius. But if you're trying to choose between two theories and one gives you an excuse for being lazy the other one is probably right.”
“There is all the more reason for startups to write Webbased software now because writing desktop software has become a lot less fun. If you want to write desktop software now you do it on Microsoft's terms calling their APIs and working around their buggy OS. And if you manage to write something that takes off you may find that you were merely doing market research for Microsoft.”
“If you have to choose between two theories prefer the one that doesn't center on you.”
“If Apple were to grow the iPod into a cell phone with a web browser Microsoft would be in big trouble.”
“If you can keep hope and worry balanced they will drive a project forward the same way your two legs drive a bicycle forward.”
“Dressing up is inevitably a substitute for good ideas. It is no coincidence that techincally inept business types are known as "suits.”
“We need a language that lets us scribble and smudge and smear not a language where you have to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make polite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.”
“Paying attention is more important to reliability than moving slowly. Because he pays close attention a Navy pilot can land a 40000 lb. aircraft at 140 miles per hour on a pitching carrier deck at night more safely than the average teenager can cut a bagel.”
“It’s hard to do a really good job on anything you don’t think about in the shower.”
“Just fix things that seem broken regardless of whether it seems likes the problem is important enough to build a company on.”
“So if you can figure out a way to get in a design war with a company big enough that its software is designed by product managers they’ll never be able to keep up with you. These opportunities are not easy to find though. It’s hard to engage a big company in a design war just as it’s hard to engage an opponent inside a castle in handtohand combat.”
“Someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US. That phenomenon is only going to become more pronounced. You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on that if people don't think you're weird you're living badly.”
“Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.”
“When I was in art school we were looking one day at a slide of some great fifteenth century painting and one of the students asked 'Why don't artists paint like that now?' The room suddenly got quiet. Though rarely asked out loud this question lurks uncomfortably in the back of every art student's mind. It was as if someone had brought up the topic of lung cancer in a meeting within Philip Morris.'Well' the professor replied 'we're interested in different questions now.' He was a pretty nice guy but at the time I couldn't help wishing I could send him back to fifteenth century Florence to explain in person to Leonardo & Co. how we had moved beyond their early limited concept of art. Just imagine that conversation.In fact one of the reasons artists in fifteenth century Florence made such great things was that they believed you could make great things. They were intensely competitive and were always trying to outdo one another like mathematicians or physicists today—maybe like anyone who has ever done anything really well.The idea that you could make great things was not just a useful illusion. They were actually right. So the most important consequence of realizing there can be good art is that it frees artists to try to make it.”
“The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful. Let the nerds keep their lunch money and you rule the world.”
“Introducing change is like pulling off a bandage : the pain is a memory as soon as you feel it.”
“You can go anywhere in books”
