A well-known roulette trick, to make a profit for sure, is the following:
you stake continuously at one color, for example red,
double the bet if you lose, and stop as soon as you win.
Because you get twice your bet back if you win, and the ball will once fall on red,
you know that you will gain your original bet as profit
(you must, however, have an infinite amount of money to be able to double your bet every time when necessary).
The expected value for your profit is therefore equal to your original bet.

A large space agency has decided to build a base on the moon.

Long ago, there was a king who had six sons. The king possessed a huge amount of gold,
which he hid carefully in a building consisting of a number of rooms.
In each room there were a number of chests; this number of chests was equal to the number of rooms in the building.
Each chest contained a number of golden coins that equaled the number of chests per room.
When the king died, one chest was given to the royal barber.
The remainder of the coins had to be divided fairly between his six sons.

Here is a little problem from the physical/electro-technical area.
Only basic knowledge about electricity and resistance is required, like:

A cable, 16 meters in length, hangs between two pillars that are both 15 meters high.
The ends of the cable are attached to the tops of the pillars. At its lowest point, the cable hangs 7 meters above the ground.

We want to find the smallest, right-angled triangle for which holds:

The fraction

There is a whole number n for which the following holds:
if you put a 4 at the end of n, and multiply the number you get in that way by 4,
the result is equal to the number you get if you put a 4 in front of n.
In other words, we are looking for the number you can put on the dots in the following equation:

In the pub of a quiet little village, the bartender and the local schoolteacher had the following conversation.
The bartender said: "Pastor Petersen was visited by three women today.
Can you work out how old they are, if you know that the product of their ages is 2450,
and that together they are as old as you are?"
After a deep consideration, the teacher said: "No, I can't."
Then the bartender said: "Of course you can't, but if I tell you that the oldest woman is older than pastor Petersen,
you should be able to work it out."

The story goes that when the Swiss did not have so much experience yet with making clocks,
a painful mistake was made with a church clock.
The clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock.
Soon it was noticed that the hour hand and minute hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong axes.
The result was that the hour hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute hand.
When the clock maker arrived, a remarkable thing happened:
on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time again.

A military column of 1 km length marches with a constant speed of 6 kilometers per hour.
A courier from the back of the column is sent to the head of the column by bike to deliver a message.
Arrived at the front, he instantly returns.
When he returns at the back, the column has travelled a distance of 1 km since the start of his errand.
The courier drove with constant speed.

Last winter, someone made two snowballs, one of which had twice as big a diameter as the other one.
Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate, and the snowballs started to melt soon.
The melting only took place at the surface of the balls,
so the speed with which the balls melted was proportional to the surface of the (remainder of the) balls.

Friday the thirteenth: a well-known phenomenon. For one, a day to stay in bed, for another just superstition.
