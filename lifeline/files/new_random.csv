With the digits 1 up to 9, you must make 100, using the following rules:


Each digit must be used exactly once.
The only allowed operation is addition.
Two single digits may be combined to form a number (so, for example, 2 and 4 may be combined to 24 or 42).
Two single digits may be combined to form a fraction (so, for example, 2 and 4 may be combined to 2/4 or 4/2).

, The Question:
How can this be done?


We have the following long division:


       . . 9 / 6 . 8 . . . \ . 5 3
               . . . 2
               -------
                 . 9 . .
                 . . 4 .
                 -------
                   . . 4 .
                   . . . .
                   -------
                         0

What does the complete long division look like?


A well-known roulette trick, to make a profit for sure, is the following:
you stake continuously at one color, for example red,
double the bet if you lose, and stop as soon as you win.
Because you get twice your bet back if you win, and the ball will once fall on red,
you know that you will gain your original bet as profit
(you must, however, have an infinite amount of money to be able to double your bet every time when necessary).
The expected value for your profit is therefore equal to your original bet.


Assume, however, that there is a maximum stake for the roulette,
which means that you can only stake n consecutive times with this trick.

, The Question:
What is the expected value for your profit for this limited roulette?


A large space agency has decided to build a base on the moon.
For this purpose, a cable must be laid around the moon's equator.
When the cable is laid, it turns out to be 1 meter short.
In a quickly arranged meeting, it is decided to investigate the possibility to lay the whole cable in a groove.

, The Question:
How deep should this groove be to overcome the problem of the lacking 1 meter of cable?


Long ago, there was a king who had six sons. The king possessed a huge amount of gold,
which he hid carefully in a building consisting of a number of rooms.
In each room there were a number of chests; this number of chests was equal to the number of rooms in the building.
Each chest contained a number of golden coins that equaled the number of chests per room.
When the king died, one chest was given to the royal barber.
The remainder of the coins had to be divided fairly between his six sons.

, The Question:
Is a fair division possible in all situations?


Here is a little problem from the physical/electro-technical area.
Only basic knowledge about electricity and resistance is required, like:


The replacement resistance of two serial-connected resistances 
 
is 2 Ohm (Rreplacement = R1 + R2, where R1 = R2 = 1).
The replacement resistance of two parallel-connected resistances 
 
is 1/2 Ohm (1/Rreplacement = 1/R1 + 1/R2, where R1 = R2 = 1).

, The Question:
What is the replacement resistance of the circuit below?


A cable, 16 meters in length, hangs between two pillars that are both 15 meters high.
The ends of the cable are attached to the tops of the pillars. At its lowest point, the cable hangs 7 meters above the ground.

, The Question:
How far are the two pillars apart?


We want to find the smallest, right-angled triangle for which holds:


The lengths of the sides are whole numbers.
The circumference is the square of a whole number.
The area is a whole number to the power of three.


To help you a bit: the length of the hypotenuse is 240.

, The Question:
What are the dimensions of this triangle?


The fraction


EVE/DID = 0,TALKTALKTALKTALK...


is a normal fraction that can also be written as a recurring decimal.

, The Question:
Which fraction is this (equal letters are equal digits)?


There is a whole number n for which the following holds:
if you put a 4 at the end of n, and multiply the number you get in that way by 4,
the result is equal to the number you get if you put a 4 in front of n.
In other words, we are looking for the number you can put on the dots in the following equation:


4... = 4 Ã— ...4

, The Question:
Which number must be put on the dots to get a correct equation?


In the pub of a quiet little village, the bartender and the local schoolteacher had the following conversation.
The bartender said: "Pastor Petersen was visited by three women today.
Can you work out how old they are, if you know that the product of their ages is 2450,
and that together they are as old as you are?"
After a deep consideration, the teacher said: "No, I can't."
Then the bartender said: "Of course you can't, but if I tell you that the oldest woman is older than pastor Petersen,
you should be able to work it out."

, The Question:
How old is pastor Petersen?


Farmer Bob owns a piece of grassland and three animals: a cow, a goat, and a goose.
Bob discovered the following:


When the cow and the goat graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 45 days.
When the cow and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 60 days.
When the cow grazes on the field alone, there is no more grass after 90 days.
When the goat and the goose graze on the field together, there is no more grass after 90 days also.

, The Question:
For how long can the three animals graze on the field together?

With the digits 1, 4, 5 and 6, you must make 24, using the following rules:


each digit must be used exactly once;
the allowed operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (note: exponentiation is therefore not allowed!);
digits may not be concatenated (so, for example, it is not allowed to use 1 and 4 as 14);
brackets are allowed.

, The Question:
Give the two solutions to this problem.


The story goes that when the Swiss did not have so much experience yet with making clocks,
a painful mistake was made with a church clock.
The clock was officially put into use when it showed 6 o'clock.
Soon it was noticed that the hour hand and minute hand had been interchanged and attached to the wrong axes.
The result was that the hour hand moved with a speed twelve times higher than the minute hand.
When the clock maker arrived, a remarkable thing happened:
on the moment he inspected the clock, it showed exactly the right time again.

, The Question:
If the clock started at 6 o'clock in the correct position,
then what was the first moment that it showed the correct time again?


A military column of 1 km length marches with a constant speed of 6 kilometers per hour.
A courier from the back of the column is sent to the head of the column by bike to deliver a message.
Arrived at the front, he instantly returns.
When he returns at the back, the column has travelled a distance of 1 km since the start of his errand.
The courier drove with constant speed.

, The Question:
How fast did the courier bike?


Last winter, someone made two snowballs, one of which had twice as big a diameter as the other one.
Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate, and the snowballs started to melt soon.
The melting only took place at the surface of the balls,
so the speed with which the balls melted was proportional to the surface of the (remainder of the) balls.

, The Question:
How much was left of the small snowball, when half of the volume of the large snowball had melted?


Friday the thirteenth: a well-known phenomenon. For one, a day to stay in bed, for another just superstition.

, The Question:

there is the largest probability that the 13th of an arbitrary month in an arbitrary year falls on that day?
Or is this probability for each day of the week the same?
